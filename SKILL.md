# CodeBTI Skill

Use this skill when a user wants to establish consistent coding style, design-pattern posture, testing policy, or collaboration workflow for a project. Trigger on: "run a CodeBTI interview", "define our coding style", "create a CodeStyle.md", "generate a SKILL.md", "create a SPEC.md", "what's our project style", or any explicit request to use CodeBTI.

## Workflow

1. Ask the required opening prompt: "What kind of project do you want to build? Please describe shortly."
2. Record the answer as the project summary. This opening prompt is not a scored fixed question.
3. Ask the 10 fixed Python questions in `python/questions/fixed-python.md`.
4. Ask exactly 5 adaptive follow-up questions using `python/questions/adaptive-question-guide.md`.
5. Record the session with `python/records/session-record.template.md`.
6. Infer the Python profile from `python/profiles/python-profile-taxonomy.md` and the pattern database in `python/patterns/`.
7. Generate `CodeStyle.md` from `python/templates/CodeStyle.template.md`.
8. Optionally distill the result into `SKILL.md` or `SPEC.md` using the templates in `python/templates/`.

## Reference Material

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `python/questions/fixed-python.md` | 10 fixed interview questions with code examples |
| `python/questions/adaptive-question-guide.md` | Rules for 5 follow-up questions |
| `python/questions/editorial-guide.md` | Editorial rules for questions |
| `python/records/session-record.template.md` | Session recording template |
| `python/profiles/python-profile-taxonomy.md` | Python profile inference rules |
| `python/patterns/` | 22 Python design-pattern pages (GoF + extras) |
| `python/templates/CodeStyle.template.md` | CodeStyle.md output template |
| `python/templates/SKILL.template.md` | SKILL.md output template |
| `python/templates/SPEC.template.md` | SPEC.md output template |

## Agent Rules

- Ask exactly one user-facing interview question per turn, including the opening prompt, fixed questions, and adaptive follow-up questions.
- Show user-facing scenarios, instructions, code examples, and choices; keep scoring/signal notes hidden unless the user asks.
- Allow the user to revise earlier answers at any time.
- Do not mix typing styles, error policies, or naming conventions inconsistently in generated output.
- Preserve session records as evidence for generated recommendations.
- Prefer markdown output over scripts or tooling unless the user explicitly requests it.
